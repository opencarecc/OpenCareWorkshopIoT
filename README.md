# IoT Workshop @ opencare.cc
Workshop material for the Care Solutions in the Internet of Things sessions

Following the tutorial in the [wiki section](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencareWorkshopIoT/wiki) of the repo you'll be able to build a prototype for a remote monitoring device.

Please check the [Workshop Keynote](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencareWorkshopIoT/blob/master/WorkshopIOT_Keynote.pdf) for further details about the sessions.

## Requirements
* [Arduino UNO](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3)
* [Arduino Ethernet Shield V2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShieldV2)
* Tinkerkit LED module
* Tinkerkit Button module
* Tinkerkit Potentiometer module
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* _Ethernet2_ Arduino library

It also works with the combination of
* Arduino Ethernet Shield
* Arduino TinkerKit Shield
* _Ethernet_ library
* _Tinkerkit_ library
(Please be sure to use the sketches in [this folder](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencareWorkshopIoT/tree/master/sketches_w_TinkerLib) if you are using this hardware) 

## Software
Please find all the Arduino code in the [Sketches](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencareWorkshopIoT/tree/master/sketches) folder.
Read comments inside the sketches for further details about the code.

If you are not using the _Arduino Ethernet Shield V2_ please find the right Arduino code in the [Sketches_w_TinkerLib](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencareWorkshopIoT/tree/master/sketches_w_TinkerLib) folder.
